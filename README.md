Hey there! Iâ€™m Shrey, an 18-year-old high school science student from India with a big passion for robotics, cybersecurity, and building cool tech. What started as a hobbyâ€”messing around with codeâ€”quickly turned into something I genuinely love. I mainly work with Python and C++, and I enjoy creating everything from bots and automation tools to full-blown apps and electronics projects. I also love diving into APIs, participating in CTF competitions, and contributing to open-source whenever I can. When Iâ€™m not busy with school or projects, Iâ€™m usually experimenting with new ideas, learning something hands-on, or thinking up my next build. In the long run, I hope to grow into a robotics engineer, cybersecurity expert, or maybe even an entrepreneur.
