I am an 18-year-old robotics and cybersecurity enthusiast, as well as a high school science student from India. My passion for technology started as a hobby and quickly evolved into something much greater. I love working with Python frameworks, designing intricate 3D models, and crafting circuits that bring ideas to life.
I primarily code in Python and C++, strongly inclined toward automation, APIs, and robotics. Whether it's building bots, robots, innovative apps, or even "useless projects" just for fun, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of creativity and functionality. As a dedicated Linux and open-source advocate, I contribute to and maintain various open-source projects on GitHub whenever possible.
My ultimate goal is to become a robotics developer, cybersecurity professional, or entrepreneur. At present, I am balancing my studies, life, and academic pursuits while continuously learning and innovating in the tech space.
